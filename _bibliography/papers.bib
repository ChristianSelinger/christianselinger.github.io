	abstract = {The vaginal microbiota is categorised into five main community state types (CST) that are known to affect women{\textquoteright}s health. Yet, there is a notable paucity of high-resolution follow-up studies lasting several months, which are required to interrogate the long-term dynamics and associations with demographic and behavioural covariates. Here, we present a high-resolution longitudinal cohort of 125 women followed for a median duration of 8.6 months, providing 11 samples per woman. Using a hierarchical Bayesian Markov model, we characterised the patterns of CST persistence and transition, simultaneously estimated the impact of 16 covariates and quantified individual variability among women. We showed that {\textquoteleft}optimal{\textquoteright} (CSTs I, II, and V) and {\textquoteleft}sub-optimal{\textquoteright} (CST III) communities are more stable in time than {\textquoteleft}non-optimal{\textquoteright} (CST IV) ones. Furthermore, we found that some covariates {\textemdash} most notably alcohol consumption {\textemdash} impacted the probability of shifting from one CST to another. We performed counterfactual simulations to confirm that alterations of key covariates, such as alcohol consumption, could shape the prevalence of different microbiota communities in the population. Finally, our analyses indicated that there is a relatively canalised pathway leading to the deterioration of vaginal microbiota communities, whereas the paths to recovery can be highly individualised among women. In addition to providing one of the first insights into vaginal microbiota dynamics over a year, our study showcases a novel application of a hierarchical Bayesian Markov model to clinical cohort data with many covariates. Our findings pave the way for an improved mechanistic understanding of microbial dynamics in the vaginal environment and the development of novel preventative and therapeutic strategies to improve vaginal health.Competing Interest StatementJReynes reports personal fees from Gilead (consulting and payment or honoraria for lectures, presentations, speaker{\textquoteright}s bureaus, manuscript writing, or educational events), Janssen (payment or honoraria for lectures, presentations, speaker{\textquoteright}s bureaus, manuscript writing, or educational events), Merck (payment or honoraria for lectures, presentations, speaker{\textquoteright}s bureaus, manuscript writing, or educational events), Theratechnologies (payment or honoraria for lectures, presentations, speaker{\textquoteright}s bureaus, manuscript writing, or educational events), and ViiV Healthcare (consulting and payment or honoraria for lectures, presentations, speaker{\textquoteright}s bureaus, manuscript writing, or educational events) and support for attending meetings and/or travel from Gilead and Pfizer, outside of the submitted work.

	abstract = {Objectives HPV infections are ubiquitous. For most infections, we lose track of the presence of the virus in host in less than three years after the start of infection. The mechanisms regulating the persistence of HPV infection are still partially understood. In this work, we focus on incident HPV detection in young women and we characterise the dynamics of these infections and evaluate the effect of genotype and host socio-economic factors on the duration of HPV detection and time between detection.Methods We investigated human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype detection patterns in 182 young women in Montpellier, France. We relied on SPF10-LiPA25 screening assay for the simultaneous de-tection of 25 HPV genotypes. We used survival analysis tools with frailty effects to investigate the contribution of viral and host factors to variations in the time of HPV detectability, time of first incident detection, and time before re-detection.Results Women of the PAPCLEAR cohort experienced numerous positive HPV events, including frequent redetection of the same genotype. We retrieve classical results that HR-genotypes are detected for longer duration than LR-genotypes. HR-genotypes were also more liekly to be detected than LR-genotypes during the follow-up. The number of lifetime sexual partner was strongly associated with increased risk of new positive detection while vaccination was related to a lower risk of displaying incident infections. Covariates related to socio-economic difficulties were associated with longer duration of HPV positivity.Conclusions Young women display numerous event of HPV detection, with frequent codetections of multiple genotypes at the same time and redetection of the same type after periods of no detection. These new detection are almost certainly the result of new acquisition from sexual partners, with little evidence of re-emergence of latent infections. A better characterisation of transient infections might help unveil doubts and misconception on HPV physiopathology, favouring adherence to preventive policies.Competing Interest StatementJ.
