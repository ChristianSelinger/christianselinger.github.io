A mathematician by trade, I have been working in **infectious disease modeling** for the past 10 years. 


Infectious disease dynamics are **multi-scale** by definition. The combination of **pathogen** or **immune dynamics** within a host and changing patterns of transmission-relevant **interactions between hosts** result in rich population-level phenomena. Ranging from stochastic emergence and extinction, to structured and well-mixed epidemic processes, I am interested in applying **mathematical** and **statistical concepts** to answer questions from the angle of **public health**:  

* What is the role of host response to infection towards [disease outcome](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-15-1161)?

* When does within-host [heterogeneity](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2022.0232) matter for disease dynamics at the population level?

* How can we [disentangle](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.08.029) various [sources](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2002468) of heterogeneity to evaluate [intervention](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.02.073) effectiveness?

I have been working mainly on pathogens and diseases affecting humans such as HIV, Influenza, Polio, HPV, Coronaviruses and Malaria.

I am currently employed at the [Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute](https://swisstph.ch).
