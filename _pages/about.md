A mathematician by trade, I have been working in **infectious disease modeling** for the past 10 years. 


Infectious disease dynamics are **multi-scale** by definition. The combination of pathogen or immune dynamics within a host and changing patterns of transmission-relevant interactions between hosts result in rich population-level phenomena. Ranging from stochastic emergence and extinction, to structured and well-mixed epidemic processes, I am interested in applying **mathematical and statistical concepts** to answer **public health questions**:

* How does within-host heterogeneity matter for disease dynamics at the population level?

* How can we evaluate the effectiveness of existing and future disease prevention technologies?

I have been working mainly on human pathogens such as HIV, Influenza, Polio, HPV, Coronaviruses and Malaria.
