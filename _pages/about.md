A mathematician by trade, I have been working in infectious disease modeling for the past 10 years. 

Infectious disease dynamics are multi-scale by definition. The combination of pathogen or immune dynamics within a host and changing patterns of transmissible contacts between hosts result in rich population-level phenomena. Ranging from stochastic emergence and extinction, to structured and well-mixed epidemic processes, I am interested in applying mathematical and statistical concepts to answer the following key questions:

** When does heterogeneity matter when it comes to effectiveness of interventions at the population level?

** Which are the relevant quantities that should be measured to disentangle sources of heterogeneity?

** How can we evaluate the effectiveness and improve the design for future prevention technologies?


a) polio cessation paper fecal-matter exposure, 
b) emergence
c) hiv
