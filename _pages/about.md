A mathematician by trade, I have been working in infectious disease modeling for the past 10 years. 

Infectious disease dynamics are **multi-scale** by definition. The combination of pathogen or immune dynamics within a host and changing patterns of transmission-relevant interactions between hosts result in rich population-level phenomena. Ranging from stochastic emergence and extinction, to structured and well-mixed epidemic processes, I am interested in applying **mathematical and statistical concepts** to answer **public health questions**:

* When does heterogeneity matter when it comes to effectiveness of interventions at the population level?

* Which are the relevant quantities that should be measured to disentangle sources of heterogeneity?

* How can we evaluate the effectiveness of existing interventions and improve the design for future technologies?

b) emergence
c) hiv
