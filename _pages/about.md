I am a mathematician by trade, and have been working in infectious disease modeling for the past 10 years. 

Infectious disease dynamics are multi-scale by definition. The combination of pathogen or immune dynamics within a host and changing patterns of transmissible contacts between hosts result in rich population-level phenomena. Ranging from stochastic emergence and extinction, to well-mixed processes structured by host age, mobility or genetics, I am interested in applying mathematical and statistical concepts to answer the following key questions:

a) When does heterogeneity matter when it comes to effectiveness of interventions at the population level?

b) Which are the relevant quantities that should be measured to disentangle sources of heterogeneity?

c) How can we improve the design for future prevention technologies?


a) polio cessation paper fecal-matter exposure, 
b) emergence
c) hiv 



Infectious disease modeling is very much a human activity. Parameterizing phenomological descriptions of disease
with the help of mathematical functions or computer code requires many implicit and explicit choices.
At the core of each infectious disease model is the contagion process. Therein infectious individuals 
act as catalysts upon substrates, the susceptible individuals. The product of this reaction is another
infectious individual, and the reaction continues until an equilibrium state is reached.
Structuring the contagion process follows three major axes: 
time: Does the next reaction depend not only on the present but also past states of the system?
host: Does a host's age, immunity, position in space/network, and mobility determine the coupling of catalyst and substrate?
pathogen: How do genetics, antigenicity and phenotype of the pathogen modulate the strength of the reaction?
