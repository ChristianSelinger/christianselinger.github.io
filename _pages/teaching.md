<h2>Introduction to simulation algorithms & numerics for epidemiological models</h2>

We start with compartmental models by discussing frequency vs. density-dependent transmission models. Then, we give examples of different approaches to **solve numerically deterministic** dynamical systems of epidemics. In the major part, we study in detail **biochemical reaction network** simulation algorithms. Towards the end we also glimpse into numerics of **stochastic differential equations**. 

Particular emphasis is on **practicals with toy models**, but you will also find sketches of proofs and links to rigorous mathematical theory.

You can have a look at the slides <a href="/assets/pdf/modsimul_20240111.pdf">here</a>.

Code in R and solutions for exercises upon request!

Any comments and suggestions are appreciated!

This course has been taught at the <a href="https://aims-senegal.org/">African Institute for Mathematical Sciences</a> in Senegal.


<h2>Advanced infectious disease models</h2>

We start with compartmental models of disease transmission. Then, we give examples of different approaches to **solve numerically deterministic** dynamical systems of epidemics. We study in detail **vector-host** models with applications to vector control. Then we discuss next-generation matrix and Lotka-Euler approaches to **basic reproduction number** calculations with many examples. We develop various notions of **sensitivity analysis** and perform **curve fitting** but also more advanced **parameter inference** techniques on real-world epidemiological data covering frequentist, likelihoodidst and Bayesian approaches. Finally, we build a multi-strain toy model of malaria to study the population-level impact of drug resistance.

Particular emphasis is on **practicals with toy models**, but you will also find sketches of proofs and links to rigorous mathematical theory.
