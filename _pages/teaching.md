<h3>Simulation algorithms & numerics for epidemiological models </h3>
This is a pre-doctoral course on stochastic simulation algorithms and numerics for epidemiological models, taught at the <a href="https://aims-senegal.org/">African Institute for Mathematical Sciences</a> in Senegal. 

We start with compartmental models by discussing frequency vs. density-dependent transmission models. Then, we give examples of different approaches to solve numerically deterministic dynamical systems of epidemics. In the major part, we study in detail biochemical reaction network simulation algorithms. Towards the end we also glimpse into numerics of stochastic differential equations. 

Particular emphasis is on practicals with toy models, but you will also find sketches of proofs and links to rigorous mathematical theory.

You can have a look at the slides <a href="/assets/pdf/MaModAfrica_TrainingSchoolSenegal2023_modsimul_20240111.pdf">here</a>.

Code and solutions for exercises upon request!

Any comments and suggestions are appreciated!
